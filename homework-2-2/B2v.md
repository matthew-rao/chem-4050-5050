# B2v Behavior

## B2v Description
B2v describes non-ideal gaseous behaviors by taking into acc
## Hard-Sphere Potential
The hard-sphere potential remains relatively constant as the distance varies. This is due to the fact that temperature has relatively little effect on the B2v value for hard spheres. Because these spheres always occupy space, there always exists repulsion (hence the positive B2v value). The flat slope of the hard-sphere potential indicates no attraction between the molecules.
## Square-Well Potential
The square well has a horizontal attractive region as well as a horizontal repulsive region. This indicates that temperature will come into play. Indeed, we see that around 320K the Boyle temperature is reached, where the attractive and repulsive forces are equal. Increasing temperature therefore brings it closer to the hard-sphere potential and increases repulsion.
## Lennard Jones
The Lennard Jones graph shows a significant negative slope until sigma is reached, then decreases slightly until the minimum is reached. Then, it increases slightly toward an asymptotic value. This aligns with the B2v values in which the B2v increases from negatie to positive in order to increase repulsive forces.
