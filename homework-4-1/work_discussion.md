# Thermodynamic Processes Discussion

## Comparison
We see that for the plot, the work done for an isothermal process is greater in magnitude than the work done for the adiabatic process. That is, the isothermal curve has a steeper slope than the adiabatic curve.

## Isothermal
In an isothermal process, the gas is expanding at a constant temperature. However, this does not mean that heat is constant. Rather, the heat that enters the system is converted to work done on the gas to keep the temperature constant. Therefore, at a higher volume, more work is needed to be done to maintain this internal temperature.

## Adiabatic
In an adiabatic processes, however, the gas is expanding with no heat exchange from the environment.
Therefore, the temperature will decrease as the gas expands its volume. Therefore, less work is needed to be done as at a higher volume, the temperature drops.
